Pseudocode that reads in three numbers and writes them all in sorted order

Start Program 
Given 3 integers a, b, c
Read the integers
Check if a is not <= b or it is not <= c then it is not the smallest
Check if b is <= c
Then a is not <= b and b is not <= c
Print a,b,c

Else
Check if a is not <= c or c is not <= b
Then write a,c,b

Check if b is not <= a or it is not <= c then it is not the smallest
Check if a is <= c
Then b is not <= a and a is not <= c
Print b,a,c

Else
Check if b is not <= c or c is not <= a
Then write b,c,a

Check if c is not <= a or it is not <= c then it is not the smallest
Check if a is <= b
Then c is not <= a and a is not <= b
Print c,a,b

Else
Check if c is not <= b or b is not <= a
Then write c,b,a
